# Support

This is an MIT-licensed open source project with its ongoing development made possible thanks to the support by the contributors. This framework is a result of the long road, full of sleepless nights, working after hours, and busy weekends.

## How can you help?

This doesn't have a large company that sits behind and is continuously paying for hours spent on the maintanance & development. I fully rely on the goodness ❤️ of the people. However, I would love to make this project grow even more with regular updates and maintanance, to be fully focused on delivering you great solutions that make coding process enjoyable: In order to help me, I run few supporting platforms:

- **Become a backer or sponsor on for the project**
- **Use bKash to send a one-time donation**
- **Or reach me directly: merajkazi20@gmail.com**

If you got any help from this project, consider sponsoring its development & maintanance to ensure that the project keeps growing. Also, your support could help me to work more on this project which benefits thousands of freshers, learners, developers.
