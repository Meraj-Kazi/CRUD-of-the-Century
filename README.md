### Preface 

Hello there!
Are you willing learn a programming language that you know nothing about?

Sit tight with me. You'll see how much easy and effective it is to learn a completely new programming language or framework through crud operation without any prior knowledge. But please keep in mind, you'll have to go through each and every line of the documents I provide to understand the concepts clearly. I have carefully wrote down the docs so that it can be understood by school kids. That means it becomes easy to understand for anyone of any age. **DO NOT SKIP ANYTHING**.

###### In case you don't know what CRUD actually is - 

## Despite being commonly pronounced /krÊŒd/, CRUD is not a word. Itâ€™s an abbreviation that stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete or Destroy. 

#### What is CRUD?

CRUD refers to the four basic operations a software application should be able to perform â€“ Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

In such apps, users must be able to **create data**, have access to the data in the UI by **reading** the data, **update** or edit the data, and **delete** the data.

In full-fledged applications, CRUD apps consist of 3 parts: an API (or server), a database, and a user interface (UI).

The API contains the code and methods, the database stores and helps the user retrieve the information, while the user interface helps users interact with the app.

You can make a CRUD app with any of the programming languages out there. And the app doesnâ€™t have to be full stack â€“ you can make a CRUD app with client-side JavaScript.

Each letter in the CRUD acronym has a corresponding HTTP request method.

|  CRUD Operation  |  HTTP request method  |
| :------------------------ | :-------------: | 
|  Create  |  POST  |
|  Read  |  GET  |
|  Update  |  PUT or PATCH  |
|  Delete  |  DELETE  |
